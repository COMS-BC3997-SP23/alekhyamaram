<p>We continued to focus on data analysis this week; we finished empathy mapping all direct report interviews, and some of the manager interviews. Juan has opened a few channels of communication in an attempt to find former clients who have completed coaching engagements and might be willing to talk to usâ€“as a startup, the operational/logistical part of UX research is often the most difficult. Larger companies with greater UX maturity often have existing pools of users that they use for research/testing purposes, but at Sounding Board, all of the recruitment work falls on the designers &amp; researchers themselves.</p>

<p>Juan and I spent all day Friday affinity mapping. We took the data from individualsâ€™ empathy maps and started to group it into key themes/patterns. The process really helped us process and synthesize our thoughts, and allowed us to identify some key questions/knowledge gaps that we want to take a look at next. Our goal is to eventually synthesize all of this data into persona cards that really strongly exemplify the trends weâ€™re seeing in manager-direct report relationships.</p>

<p>I spoke to Janie (Head of Product and Design) about our results. We had an interesting discussion about how the research weâ€™re doing now marks the beginning of a much larger process, and is one piece of the companyâ€™s reappraisal of the managerâ€™s role in a coaching journey. Super exciting!</p>
