<p>This week was a super busy &amp; productive one! We conducted several interviews internally at Sounding Board with both managers and direct reports to learn more about how managers play a role in direct reports’ career trajectories and leadership development journeys. We’ve started analyzing that data through empathy mapping, a method used to analyze interview data. What each participant “says,” “feels,” “does,” and “thinks” is mapped accross four quadrants. It allows us to start breaking down the raw interview data so that we can find patterns/themes accross participants.</p>

<p>Next week, we’ll continue doing interviews with external participants, and we’ll contiue to analyze the data through empathy mapping!</p>
