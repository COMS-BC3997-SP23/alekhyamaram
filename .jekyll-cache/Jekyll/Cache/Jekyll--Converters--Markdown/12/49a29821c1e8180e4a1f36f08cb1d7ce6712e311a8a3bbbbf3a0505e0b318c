<p>We continued to focus on data analysis this week; we finished empathy mapping all direct report interviews, and some of the manager interviews. Juan has opened a few channels of communication in an attempt to find former clients who have completed coaching engagements and might be willing to talk to usâ€“as a startup, the operational/logistical part of UX research is often the most difficult. Larger companies with greater UX maturity often have existing pools of users that they use for research/testing purposes, but at Sounding Board, all of the recruitment work falls on the designers &amp; researchers themselves.</p>

<p>Juan and I spent all day Friday affinity mapping. We took the data from individualsâ€™ empathy maps and started to group it into key themes/patterns. The process really helped us process and synthesize our thoughts, and allowed us to identify some key questions/knowledge gaps that we want to take a look at next. Our goal is to eventually synthesize all of this data into persona cards that really strongly exemplify the trends weâ€™re seeing in manager-direct report relationships.</p>

<p>I spoke to Janie (Head of Product and Design) about our results. We had an interesting discussion about how the research weâ€™re doing now marks the beginning of a much larger process, and is one piece of the companyâ€™s reappraisal of the managerâ€™s role in a coaching journey. Super exciting!</p>

<p><em>What are empathy maps?</em></p>

<p>Much like personas, empathy maps are a user-centered design method used to organize information about users in a digestible way. They are used to foster a more holistic and empathetic understanding of end users. Empathy maps most commonly have four quadrants: Says, Does, Thinks, and Feels. They are populated with interview data; for example, if a designer were to interview a customer, they would place their actions in the â€˜Doesâ€™ quadrant, their emotions in the â€˜Feelsâ€™ quadrant, their thoughts in the â€˜Thinksâ€™ quadrant, and direct quotes in the â€˜Saysâ€™ quadrant. Aggregated empathy maps are also commonly used; rather than mapping an individualâ€™s thoughts, emotions, and actions,  a designer might gather data from several users and organize it within one map (Gibbons, 2018).</p>

<p>Empathy mapping can be a useful tool in the persona-creation process, as it allows designers to break down individual usersâ€™ data and spot patterns/emerging themes. The data can then be synthesized into a persona, or an archetypal user (Knight, 2019). In a 2015 study, a majority of participants reported that using an empathy map made persona-creation quicker, more productive. All of them agreed that empathy mapping made the process easier and more effective (Ferreira et al., 2015).</p>

<p>Although Juan and I have already created proto-personas, weâ€™re planning to go back and revise them after analyzing our interview data through empathy mapping. Weâ€™ll flesh them out and present them to the design team some time in the next few weeks.</p>
