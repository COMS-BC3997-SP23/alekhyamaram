<p>This week, Juan interviewed two external stakeholders for the manager journey project! I performed empathy mapping to analyze the data from each interview. We will continue to analyse the data through affinity mapping, as well as hopefully conduct more interviews with externals stakeholders.</p>

<p>This week, I read part of a a book about value-sensitive design methods. As a continuation of this project, I propose using the value-sensitive design framework and its methodologies (such as stakeholder analysis, value scenarios, value dams and flows, and value-oriented mockups &amp; prototypes) to carve out a role for the manager in the coaching journey (Friedman et al., 2017). This process would center the values of autonomy and privacy for the coachee/DR, while also allowing for flexibility, so that the coachee may bring their manager into their coaching journey if they so choose.</p>

<p><em>Stakeholder Analysis</em></p>

<p>On the Sounding Board platform, direct stakeholders in a coaching engagement include (1) the coachee/direct report, (2) the coach, and (3)  the coachee’s manager. All three interact with the platform in order to support a coachee in their  leadership development journey, though the manager’s role in this process is far more ambiguous.  Coaches schedule regular coaching sessions with their clients through the platform. Coachees document their goals, actions, and insights on the leader development roadmap, and can solicit feedback/comments from their manager. Managers have the power to comment on their direct report’s goals, provided that said goals are made visible to them. They might also engage in a manager alignment call with a coachee and their coach at the beginning of an engagement.</p>

<p>Indirect stakeholders in a coaching engagement include (1) the company/organization that is offering coaching services to their employees, (2) the company sponsor (the person who initiated &amp; manages the contract with Sounding Board, typically a high-ranking person from HR), and (3) a coachee’s colleagues. The changes and growth a coachee undergoes throughout an engagement impact the ways in which they interact with their team and contribute to their company’s work and culture.</p>
