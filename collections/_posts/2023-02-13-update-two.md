## Project Update

This week, I worked on some proto-personas for the manager journey project. My readings from last week were really useful in shaping my thinking—so often, people create design artifacts in order to check off boxes, but I really wanted to make sure I was being intentional about the purpose these personas would serve. 

I had a meeting with the company’s head of product and design, and we discussed different approaches to persona-creation. We talked about the importance of context-setting while communicating design decisions, and how personas might play a role in that. She was really excited about the extra research I was doing, so creating a standing deck of SB persona cards for regular use may actually become a separate design project for me!  Once I have more robust data, I’ll go back and refresh the proto-personas I created.

My supervisor and I also finalized the research plan for the manager journey project:

<ul>
  <li>conduct contextual inquiry interviews with both internal and external stakeholders</li>
  <li>create empathy maps for each interviewee</li>
  <li>aggregate all of that data into an affinity map</li>
  <li>record a video presentation to deliver insights to stakeholders</li>
</ul>

We’ve started to brainstorm some questions for the interviews as well. 

## Readings

For my supplementary research this week, I read Interviewing Users: How To Uncover Compelling Insights by design researcher and consultant Steve Portigal. I thought it might provide useful information for the contextual interviews we’ll be conducting next week. 

Some important insights from the book include:
<ul>
  <li>You should always have a field guide prepared for your interview. The field guide should have subsections, starting with a broad overview/introduction in which you break the ice & build rapport with a participant, then the main body section where you ask the bulk of your questions, followed by a few questions about their “ideal experience”, and finally some concluding remarks.</li>
  <li>Before starting to interview customers, you should first meet with and interview internal stakeholders to make sure everyone is aligned on the project objectives & get a feel for the problem space.</li>
  <li>When possible, ask someone to demonstrate an activity rather than try to recall it and walk you through the process. Memory is notoriously unreliable, and there’s a lot you can learn just from watching someone do something (ethnography).</li>
  <li>Some tools/methods you can use in an interview include mapping, prototypes, and storyboarding.</li>
  <li>Silence is actually an incredibly important element in the interview process. Rather than trying to fill silence, just let it stand—this often leads to a participant elaborating on what they’ve just said/providing more information.</li>
  <li>Always ask followup questions!</li>
  <li>When possible, use the participant’s terminology–you want to get a sense of their world and perspective.</li>
  <li>Always remember that you are there to learn from the participant—they are the expert, not you.</li>
  <li>Use a topline report to highlight preliminary findings and emerging themes, and use affinity mapping for more in depth data analysis.</li>
</ul>
