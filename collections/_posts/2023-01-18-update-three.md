## Project Update

This week was a super busy & productive one! We conducted several interviews internally at Sounding Board with both managers and direct reports to learn more about how managers play a role in direct reports' career trajectories and leadership development journeys. We conducted 4 reviews with direct reports and 3 with managers. We're hoping to get one more manager next week. 

We've started analyzing that data through empathy mapping, a method used to analyze interview data. What each participant "says," "feels," "does," and "thinks" is mapped accross four quadrants. It allows us to start breaking down the raw interview data so that we can find patterns/themes accross participants.

Next week, we'll start searching for external participants participants to interview, and we'll contiue to analyze the data through empathy mapping! 

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to do my independent study readings this week because I was swamped with midterms. However, I'll make sure to fill in this missed entry during Spring Break!
