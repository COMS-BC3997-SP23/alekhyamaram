## Project Update

We continued to focus on data analysis this week; we finished empathy mapping all direct report interviews, and some of the manager interviews. Juan has opened a few channels of communication in an attempt to find former clients who have completed coaching engagements and might be willing to talk to us--as a startup, the operational/logistical part of UX research is often the most difficult. Larger companies with greater UX maturity often have existing pools of users that they use for research/testing purposes, but at Sounding Board, all of the recruitment work falls on the designers & researchers themselves. 

Juan and I spent all day Friday affinity mapping. We took the data from individuals' empathy maps and started to group it into key themes/patterns. The process really helped us process and synthesize our thoughts, and allowed us to identify some key questions/knowledge gaps that we want to take a look at next. Our goal is to eventually synthesize all of this data into persona cards that really strongly exemplify the trends we're seeing in manager-direct report relationships. 

I spoke to Janie (Head of Product and Design) about our results. We had an interesting discussion about how the research we're doing now marks the beginning of a much larger process, and is one piece of the company's reappraisal of the manager's role in a coaching journey. Super exciting!
